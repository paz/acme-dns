# Security Audit Checklist for Production Deployment

This checklist ensures acme-dns is production-ready with all security measures in place.

## ✅ Critical Security Issues (ALL RESOLVED)

- [x] **SQL Injection** - Fixed with parameterized queries

- [x] **Outdated Dependencies** - All updated to latest stable

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- [x] Bcrypt password hashing (cost 12 for web, cost 10 for API)
- [x] Session management with secure cookies
- [x] CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- [x] Authorization checks on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting per-account (currently per-IP only)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (future enhancement)

## 🛡️ Input Validation

- [x] Email validation with comprehensive regex
- [x] Password complexity requirements (12+ chars, mixed case, digits)
- [x] URL redirect whitelist validation
- [x] CIDR validation for allowFrom
- [ ] Description field length limits (recommended: 500 chars)
- [ ] Subdomain validation improvements

## 🔒 Data Protection

- [x] TLS 1.2 minimum version
- [x] Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

- [x] Authorization denials logged
- [x] Session events logged
- [ ] Failed login attempt tracking with lockout
- [ ] Audit log for admin actions
- [ ] Security event alerting

## 🔑 Session Management

- [x] Crypto-secure session ID generation (48 bytes)
- [x] Session expiration (24 hours default)
- [x] Session tied to IP and User-Agent
- [x] Logout invalidates session
- [ ] Session fixation protection (regenerate on login)
- [ ] Concurrent session limits per user
- [ ] Session cleanup for expired tokens

## 🌐 Network Security

- [x] CIDR-based IP restrictions (optional per-domain)
- [x] Rate limiting on web UI endpoints
- [x] Request size limits
- [ ] DDoS protection (deployment-specific)
- [ ] WAF integration (deployment-specific)

## 🔧 Configuration Security

- [x] Web UI disabled by default
- [x] Self-registration configurable
- [x] Debug mode warnings
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables (not config files)
- [ ] Config file permissions (0600)

## 📦 Dependency Management

- [x] All dependencies updated to latest stable
- [x] Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN resources
- [x] Dependabot configuration for automated updates
- [ ] Regular vulnerability scanning
- [ ] License compliance check

## 🐳 Container Security

- [x] Non-root user (acmedns, UID 1000)
- [x] Minimal base image (Alpine 3.21.3)
- [x] Multi-stage build
- [x] Health check configured
- [ ] Read-only root filesystem
- [ ] Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] All linters pass
- [ ] Unit tests for new features
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Load testing

## 📚 Documentation

- [x] Security report generated
- [x] Deployment guide (DOCKER.md)
- [ ] Security policy (SECURITY.md)
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] User security best practices

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review all config settings
- [ ] Set strong admin password
- [ ] Configure TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Review firewall rules

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify HTTPS working
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database connections
- [ ] Test health check endpoint

### Ongoing

- [ ] Monitor security logs
- [ ] Review Dependabot PRs weekly
- [ ] Apply security patches promptly
- [ ] Rotate secrets regularly
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update documentation

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK (Remaining)
- Rate limiting per-account (prevents distributed brute force)
- Session fixation protection
- Failed login tracking with lockout

### MEDIUM RISK (Remaining)
- Description field validation
- Additional XSS protections in other templates
- Improved CSRF token management

### LOW RISK (Remaining)
- Enhanced logging
- Additional tests
- Documentation updates

## 🎯 Recommended Timeline

**Week 1 (DONE)**
- ✅ Fix all critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Update all dependencies
- ✅ Set up automated dependency updates

**Week 2 (Recommended)**
- [ ] Implement per-account rate limiting
- [ ] Add failed login tracking
